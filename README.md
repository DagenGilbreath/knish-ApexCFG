# knish-ApexCFG
A mostly complete cfg optimized for in-game competitive servers. Make sure to read through binds and settings and change to your preferences. This is my personal config. 

To Install:
C:\Program Files(x86)\[(Steam\SteamApps\common\) or (Origin Games)]\Apex\cfg

           Paste and replace contents into \cfg folder. Make a backup of the cfg folder if you want by copying it and renaming it to cfg_backup.
           
 Remember to change settings for your preferences.
